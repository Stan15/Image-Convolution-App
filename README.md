# Image-manipulation
This project is built mainly on the python libraries "Tkinter", "numpy", and "scipy" and serves the purpose of helping me better understand the image manipulation techniques used in convolutional neural networks i.e the effect that different kernel sizes and values have on an image onto which it is convolved.

It is currently a work in progress
