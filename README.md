# Image-manipulation
This project is built mainly on the python libraries "Tkinter", "numpy", "sci-py", and "open-cv" and serves the purpose of helping me better understand the image manipulation techniques used in convolutional neural networks by understanding how convolutions are applied and the effects of different kernel shapes and values on an image onto which it is convolved.
